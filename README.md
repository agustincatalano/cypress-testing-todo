Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This is a repo for implement cypress testing/report 

The Trello app is build by https://github.com/filiphric. I will focus only on add cypress tests and reports, and NOT to fix or implement new features to the trello app itself.

eslint will run only on the tests/cypress folder, ignoring the app code.
