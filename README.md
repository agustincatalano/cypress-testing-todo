Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This is a repo for implement cypress testing/report 

## Instalation
`git clone https://github.com/agustincatalano/cypress-testing-todo.git`

`yarn install`

`yarn start`



The Trello app is build by https://github.com/filiphric and I will focus only on add cypress tests and reports, and NOT to fix or implement new features to the app itself.

eslint will run only on the tests/cypress folder, ignoring the app code.
